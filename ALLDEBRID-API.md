General informations
Introduction
Welcome to the Alldebrid API v4 ! You can use this API to access various Alldebrid services from custom applications or scripts.

Our API is organized around REST, returns JSON-encoded responses and use standard HTTP response codes.

All calls are to be made on the HTTPS endpoints. Some are public, others require to be authentificated with an apikey (see Authentication).

This API version is namespaced as v4, as such all endpoint start with /v4/ or /v4.X/, such like http://api.alldebrid.com/v4/ping or http://api.alldebrid.com/v4.1/ping.

This API v4 should be the final version regarding general response format and errors (hopefully).

If you have any issue or question, feel free to contact us.

Response format
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/ping');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);
The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "ping": "pong"
    }
}
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/endpointDontExist');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);
The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
        "code": "404",
        "message": "Endpoint doesn't exist"
    }
}
All responses return JSON with 2 attributes. The status attribute is always returned, and has a value of either success or error.

If the response is valid, you will get "status" : "success" and a data attribute, containing the response data.

If the request is invalid or an error occured, you will get "status" : "error" and an error attribute, containing the error details. All error codes and messages can be found in the errors section.

If a request doesn't return valid JSON or JSON without a status attribute, you can consider that this request failed.

This API also use HTTP status code to signal how a request went through. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a linkunlocking, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Alldebrid's servers (these are rare).

HTTP Status	Description
200 - OK	
404 - Not Found	Api endpoint doesn't exist
429 - Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly, see Rate limiting
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors	Something went wrong on Alldebrid's end
Authentication
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/ping');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);
The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "ping": "pong"
    }
}
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/user'); // Authentificated endpoint with no apikey
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);

The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
        "code": "AUTH_MISSING_APIKEY",
        "message": "The auth apikey was not sent"
    }
}
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/user');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Bearer someValidApikeyYouGenerated']);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);
The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "user": {
            // (...)
        }
    }
}
The Alldebrid API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in your Apikey dashboard, or generate them remotely (with user action) through the PIN flow.

You must send the apikey either in an Authorization: Bearer YourApikeyHere header.

All endpoints need a valid apikey except for a few public endpoints that are documented as such.

The following errors can be returned if your authentication fails.

Code	Description
AUTH_MISSING_APIKEY	The auth apikey was not sent
AUTH_BAD_APIKEY	The auth apikey is invalid
AUTH_BLOCKED	This apikey is geo-blocked or ip-blocked
AUTH_USER_BANNED	This account is banned
Rate limiting
There is rate limiting in place for the API.

Current limits are at 12 requests per second and 600 requests per minute.

Any request in excess of those limits will return a 429 or 503 errors.

If you intend to make more requests than those limits, please consider throttling or grouped calls.

Demo responses
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/user');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Bearer staticDemoApikeyPrem']);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

curl_close($ch);
The above request returns JSON structured like this :

{
    "status": "success",
    "demo": "true",
    "data": {
        "user": {
            "username": "demoUserPremium",
            "email": "demo@example.com",
            "isPremium": true,
            // (...)
        }
    }
}
The endpoints will respond with demo static data when called with the following static apikeys :

staticDemoApikeyPrem : Premium user

staticDemoApikeyTria : Trial user

staticDemoApikeyFree : Free user

Demo responses will have a demo property set to true.

Those apikeys are used for the Demos button on this documentation.

Pin auth
You can authenticate users in your application by using a PIN-auth flow. The steps are :

Get a pin code using /pin/get and display it to the user

The user submits the pin code on the Alldebrid pin page

Once submitted, the auth apikey will be available on /pin/check

Get pin
<?php

$ch = curl_init('https://api.alldebrid.com/v4.1/pin/get');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$pinInfo = json_decode($response, true);

}
The unlocking flow for streaming link is a bit more complex.

First hit the usual link/unlock endpoint. Two cases :

Stream link has only one quality : downloading link is available immediatly.
OR

Stream links has multiple qualities : you must select the desired quality to obtain a download link or delayed id by using the link/streaming endpoint.
Depending of the stream website, you'll either get a download link, or a delayed id (see Delayed link section for delayed links).

Get Status - Live Mode
The Live Mode allows to only get the new data of the status of current magnets. It is designed to make a "live" panel or monitoring system more performant when consuming the magnet/status endpoint very frequently.

It requires a session ID and a counter, and using cache on the API side only the differences between the last state and the current state are sent, greatly reducing the amount of data returned by the API on each call.

The client using this mode must keep the current state of the magnets status locally between each call in order to apply the new data on the last state to get the whole current state.

A fixed session ID (integer) must be randomly set, and a counter starting at 0 will be used. On the first call (id=123, counter=0) with a new session ID, all the current data will be sent back, with the fullsync property set to true to make it clear, and the next counter to use. On the next call the updated counter is used (id=123, counter=1), and only the differences with the previous state will be send back.

If the magnets property returned is empty, then no change happened since the last call. If some changes happened, the magnets array will have some magnet objects (see Status) with its id and the properties changed, like this :

{ "id": 123456, "downloaded": 258879224, "downloadSpeed": 20587738 }

You can them apply those diff to the last state you kept to get the current magnets status state.

If you send a counter that is not in sync with the last call response (like sending the same counter twice in a row), then the endpoint will consider your counter invalid and will return a full fullsync reponse with a reseted counter.

If you want to see a live implementation of this mode, it is currently in use on the magnet dashboard on Alldebrid.

files	array	different format depending of version property
files is an array of 1 or multiple objects representing the folder and files of the file or files. This format keep folder path informations.

Each object always have a name n string property, and an entries e array property if the object represent a folder.

Single file at root : [{"n": "some.file.avi"}]

Single file in subfolder : [{ "n": "subfolderName", "e": [ {"n": "some.file.avi"} ] }]

Single file in deeply nested subfolder : [{ "n": "subfolderName", "e": [{ "n": "deepSubfolder", "e": [ {"n": "some.file.avi"} ] }] }]

Multiple files [ { "n": "subfolderName", "e": [ {"n": "some.file.txt"}, { "n": "deepSubfolder", "e": [ {"n": "some.file.txt"}, {"n": "some.file2.doc"}, {"n": "some.file3.doc"} ] }, { "n": "otherSubfolder", "e": [ {"n": "other.file.txt"}, {"n": "other.file2.doc"} ] } ] }, {"n": "file.at.root.avi"} ]

/v4/ Magnet Status - Live Mode
 This documentation is for the deprecated /v4/ version. See Get Status - Live Mode for the /v4.1/ up-to-date endpoint.
The Live Mode allows to only get the new data of the status of current magnets. It is designed to make a "live" panel or monitoring system more performant when consuming the magnet/status endpoint very frequently.

It requires a session ID and a counter, and using cache on the API side only the differences between the last state and the current state are sent, greatly reducing the amount of data returned by the API on each call.

The client using this mode must keep the current state of the magnets status locally between each call in order to apply the new data on the last state to get the whole current state.

A fixed session ID (integer) must be randomly set, and a counter starting at 0 will be used. On the first call (id=123, counter=0) with a new session ID, all the current data will be sent back, with the fullsync property set to true to make it clear, and the next counter to use. On the next call the updated counter is used (id=123, counter=1), and only the differences with the previous state will be send back.

If the magnets property returned is empty, then no change happened since the last call. If some changes happened, the magnets array will have some magnet objects (see Status) with its id and the properties changed, like this :

{ "id": 123456, "downloaded": 258879224, "downloadSpeed": 20587738 }

You can them apply those diff to the last state you kept to get the current magnets status state.

If you send a counter that is not in sync with the last call response (like sending the same counter twice in a row), then the endpoint will consider your counter invalid and will return a full fullsync reponse with a reseted counter.

If you want to see a live implementation of this mode, it is currently in use on the magnet dashboard on Alldebrid.

<?php
$context = stream_context_create([ 'http' => [ 'ignore_errors' => true ] ]); // Suppress PHP warnings on HTTP status code >= 400

// Authentificated endpoint with valid apikey
$session = 123;
$counter = 0;

$apiEndpoint = "https://api.alldebrid.com/v4/magnet/status?apikey=someValidApikeyYouGenerated&session=" . urlencode($session) . "&counter=" . urlencode($counter);

$response = json_decode(file_get_contents($apiEndpoint, false, $context));
